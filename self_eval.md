# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    - We use conditionals when we want to look at at a certain set of data. We use conditionals to tell the computer
    which rules to check for in finding the needed answers from data.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - I unproductively struggled for a while on the spicy challenge. If I could do this again I would put it away and come back to it the next day. I also struggled for a bit with `==` as I was declaring in my lines of code rather than utilizing it corrrectly.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    - Figuring out the spicy code challenge and being able to run the code effectively felt really great. It felt good because I was able to find the needed answer online and utilize it in my code. In general, I think the productive struggle with the easier code challenges has made me feel a bit more confident in using conditionals as I've learned from many of my mistakes in writing the code through the assignment.
